# What is Ktor ?

Ktor is a Kotlin framework that allow developers to write asynchronous clients and servers applications, in Kotlin. 
While it's not entirely compatible, Ktor is targeting multiple platforms as JVM, JavaScript, Android and iOS. 

> JetBrains is working on making other platforms, like MacOS, Linux and Windows compatible.   

For this overview, we will focus on the server side of Ktor. While Ktor is not fully compatible with Kotlin Native, 
we'll work on the JVM aspect. It can be deployed with some serlvet containers (Tomcat / Jetty) or through Docker.
